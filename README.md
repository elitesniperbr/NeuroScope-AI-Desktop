> **NeuroScope AI** is a premium desktop UI prototype inspired by tools like QuickCPU,  
designed to visualize CPU behavior, system tuning states, and performance profiles  
in a clean, modern, glass-style interface.

---

## ✨ Overview

NeuroScope AI demonstrates how a next-generation **system optimization dashboard**
can look and feel.

The project focuses on:
- Visual clarity
- Professional desktop layout
- Modern glassmorphism aesthetics
- High-fidelity UI suitable for presentations and showcases

This repository is intended as a **design and architectural prototype**, not a production optimizer.

## 🧠 Concept

NeuroScope AI represents a **visual layer** for tools that:
- Monitor CPU behavior
- Display power / frequency states
- Represent optimization strategies
- Present performance profiles (gaming, balanced, power-saving)

All data shown in the UI is **simulated** and used purely for visualization purposes.
