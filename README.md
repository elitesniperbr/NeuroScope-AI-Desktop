## ✨ Overview

NeuroScope AI demonstrates how a next-generation **system optimization dashboard**
can look and feel.

The project focuses on:
- Visual clarity
- Professional desktop layout
- Modern glassmorphism aesthetics
- High-fidelity UI suitable for presentations and showcases

This repository is intended as a **design and architectural prototype**, not a production optimizer.

## 🧠 Concept

NeuroScope AI represents a **visual layer** for tools that:
- Monitor CPU behavior
- Display power / frequency states
- Represent optimization strategies
- Present performance profiles (gaming, balanced, power-saving)

All data shown in the UI is **simulated** and used purely for visualization purposes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **UI Framework:** PySide6 (Qt)
- **Charts:** Matplotlib (embedded)
- **Design Style:** Glassmorphism / Dark UI
